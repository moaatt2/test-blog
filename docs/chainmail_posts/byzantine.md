## Byzantine

### Overview

Recently I found a great [tutorial](https://www.mailleartisans.org/articles/articledisplay.php?key=14) by [Kateryne](https://www.mailleartisans.org/members/memberdisplay.php?key=62) on [M.A.I.L.](https://www.mailleartisans.org/) that shows how to create a [byzantine](https://www.mailleartisans.org/weaves/weavedisplay.php?key=13) weave. Byzantine is one of my favorite weaves and it is begginner friendly. I higly recomend trying this yourself if you are interested.

### Materials

The rings used for this peice are 14 SWG with a 1/4" internal diameter for an aspect ratio of 3.13 made of Bright Aluminum that I bought from the [Ring Lord](https://theringlord.com/).


### Notes

Byzantine is a very good design to learn for beginners as it is very simple and there are many intersting variatons on it.

Byzantine is so simple and easy that there aren't really any helpful tricks to learn about making it.

For this post I made a sample length of byzantine chain. The rings used are outside the recomended range to use for making byzantine however the end result is a fairly stiff weave; which certain projects may require.


### Final Product

Below are images of the sample length of chain I made:
