## Chainmail Cube

Recently I found a wonderful [tutorial](https://www.mailleartisans.org/articles/articledisplay.php?key=145) on [M.A.I.L.](https://www.mailleartisans.org/) that covers how to generalise the Japanese 8-in-2 sheet pattern into 3 dimmensions and create a cube.

The rings used for this peice are 14 SWG with a 1/4" internal diameter made of Bright Aluminum that I bought from the Ring Lord.

Below are some images of the completed cube:
