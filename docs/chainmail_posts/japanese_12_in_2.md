## Japanese 12-in-2

### Overview

Rounding out my initial exploration of the Japanese family of weaves is [Japanese 12-in-2](https://www.mailleartisans.org/weaves/weavedisplay.php?key=343) as submitted to [M.A.I.L.](https://www.mailleartisans.org/) by [Criterion](https://www.mailleartisans.org/members/memberdisplay.php?key=1493). Japanese 12-in-2 is the progression of [Japanese 6-in-1](japanese_6_in_1.md), which adds additional density and stability at the cost of time and resources. If you want to make it yourself, I suggest this helpful [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb7QZBvABRg) by [TheRingLord.com](https://www.youtube.com/@TheRingLordcom).


### Materials

For the sample piece showcased in this post, I used two sizes of rings made by hand(bonus post coming soon) from 16 SWG Bright Aluminum wire purchased from [The Ring Lord](https://theringlord.com/). The smaller rings have an ID(Inner Diameter) of 5mm for an AR(Aspect Ratio) of 3.1. The larger rings have an ID of 10mm for an AR of 6.1.


### Notes

The Japanese 12-in-2 weave is easy, both to learn and make. I think the weave looks stunning, and thanks to its additional stability, it doesn't rely on tension to maintain its visual appeal. As a sheet weave, you can make bracelets, necklaces, chokers, and even fabric with it. Given that this weave is easy to make, easy to learn, and aesthetically pleasing, I highly suggest learning to make this weave and using it often.
