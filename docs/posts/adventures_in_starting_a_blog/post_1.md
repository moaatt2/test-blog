## Adventures in Starting a Blog - 1

I have always been somewhat interested in making websites and thought about starting a blog. I have also heard a lot about github pages. I thought that it might be a good idea to put the two ideas together and try making a blog using github pages.

To get started I made a brand new [github repository](https://github.com/moaatt2/test-blog) to use for the blog. To start using github actions I went to the pages section of the repository settings and got set up using the hacker theme.
