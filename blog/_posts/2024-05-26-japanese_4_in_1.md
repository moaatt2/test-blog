### Overview

Recently, while searching [M.A.I.L.](https://www.mailleartisans.org/) for new weaves to try out, I came across the simplest weave of the [Japanese]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.family_page }}#Japanese) family, [Japanese 4-in-1](https://www.mailleartisans.org/weaves/weavedisplay.php?key=18) submitted by [sakredchao](https://www.mailleartisans.org/members/memberdisplay.php?key=21). Japanese 4-in-1, also historically known as So Gusari, is an old weave that saw use in Samurai armour, primarily for joining solid plates together to create a flexible end product. If you want to make it yourself, I recommend [this tutorial](https://artofmakingthings.com/articles/japanese-4-in-1-weave-tutorial) by [Simon Livingston](https://artofmakingthings.com/author/p9cnoqm5).


### Materials

For the sample piece showcased in this post, I used two sizes of rings made by hand(bonus post coming soon) from 16 {{ site.abbreviations.swg }} Bright Aluminum wire purchased from [The Ring Lord](https://theringlord.com/). The smaller rings have an {{ site.abbreviations.id }} of 5mm for an {{ site.abbreviations.ar }} of 3.1. The larger rings have an {{ site.abbreviations.id }} of 10mm for an {{ site.abbreviations.ar }} of 6.15.

### Notes

The Japanese 4-in-1 weave is easy to understand and uncomplicated to create. Its aesthetic appeal is notable, although, without tension, it can appear messy. As a versatile sheet weave, it offers nearly limitless possibilities akin to fabric. The name likely stems from its historical Japanese origins and each large ring connecting to four others. Given its ease of understanding, creation, and historical significance, I highly recommend learning to make this weave.
